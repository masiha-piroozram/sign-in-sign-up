# Sign-In/Sign-Up Project 🎉

Welcome to the **Sign-In/Sign-Up** project! This is a simple Python application that allows users to sign in and sign up. Let's dive in!

## Features ✨

- **Sign Up**: Create a new account with a username and password.
- **Sign In**: Access your account with your credentials.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy to use and understand.

## Getting Started 🚀

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/masiha-piroozram/sign-in-sign-up.git
    cd sign-in-sign-up
    ```

2. **Run the application**:
